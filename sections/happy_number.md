# Happy Number

A happy number `n` is defined by the process:

* Replaced `n` with the sum of squares of its digits
* If this process converges to 1, then it is a happy number
* If this process loops in a cycle, then it is not a happy number

## Example
```
19
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

2
2^2 = 4
4^2 = 16
1^2 + 6^2 = 37
3^2 + 7^2 = 58
5^2 + 8^2 = 89
8^2 + 9^2 = 64 + 81 = 145
1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 16 + 25 = 42
4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 4 = 20
2^2 + 0^2 = 4
```
